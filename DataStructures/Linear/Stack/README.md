# Stack Data Structure

This structure supports two main operations:

 - **Push**: Adds an element onto the top of the stack.
 - **Pop**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
  
Additionally, stacks typically supports auxiliary operations such as:

 - **Peek or Top**: Returns the top element without removing it.
 - **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
 - **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
 - **isFull**: Checks if the stack has reached its maximum capacity (if applicable).
 - **Clear**: Removes all elements from the stack.
