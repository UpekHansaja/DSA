# Time Complexity

Time complexity is a computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input. It provides an estimate of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time required for execution.

 1. Comparisons
 2. Assignments
 3. Arithmetic operations
 4. Function / Method calls

```js

void m() {                                        void m(int i) {

    int i = 20;  <------------- 1 ------------------> i += 50;

}                                                 }

```

Time complexity: O(1)         Order of 1

  **Constant time complexity**
