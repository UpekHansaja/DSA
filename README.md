## What is Data Structures?

Data structures are fundamental constructs used in software engineering to organize and manage data efficiently. They provide a way to store and manipulate data so that operations like searching, sorting, inserting, and deleting can be performed quickly and effectively.

_Data Structures are used to organize and store data to use it in an effective way when performing data operations._


*Note:*
Depending on your requirement and project, it is important to choose the right data structure for your project.

## What is Algorithm?

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of rules followed to solve problems or accomplish specific tasks. In software engineering, algorithms are essential for performing computations, data processing, and automated reasoning. They serve as the backbone for computer programs, determining how data is processed, manipulated, and transformed.

Algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired output.

### Example:
An algorithm to add two numbers:
 1. Take two numbers as input.
 2. Add numbers using the addition operator (+).
 3. Display the result.


### Qualities of a good Algorithm:

Here are some essential qualities that define a good algorithm:

 - Input & Output should be defined precisely.
 - Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
 - Algorithm should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
 - An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.
